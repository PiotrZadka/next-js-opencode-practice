# Project Plan & Learning Journal

## Goal

Master Next.js, React, and AI-driven CLI workflows (using opencode).
**Stack:** Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4.

## User Profile & System Context

**Engineer:** Piotr
**Experience Level:** Senior Frontend Engineer (6+ Years)
**Professional Background:** Enterprise-scale application development (Fintech/Lloyds, Media/Sky UK).

### Technical Competencies & Directives

The user is a Subject Matter Expert in Client-Side React logic pivoting to a Full-Stack Next.js architecture.

- **Core React (CSR):** **Expert.**
  - _Agent Note:_ Do not explain basic React hooks or state management. Focus on advanced optimization and patterns.
- **Next.js & Backend Architecture:** **Active Learning Focus.**
  - _Agent Note:_ The user is transitioning from Node/Express/GraphQL concepts to Next.js primitives. When suggesting implementation, explicitly detail the architectural reasoning behind **Server Components (RSC)**, **Hydration Boundaries**, and **Data Fetching strategies**.
- **TypeScript:** **Strict Enforcement.**
  - _Agent Note:_ Historical context is largely JavaScript. The agent must enforce strict TypeScript patterns (avoid `any`, enforce interface definitions) to align with modern enterprise standards.
- **AI & Tooling:** **Workflow Integration.**
  - _Agent Note:_ Prioritize solutions that utilize `opencode` capabilities and autonomous agents to reduce boilerplate.

## Active Context

**Current Focus**: Solidifying Next.js knowledge through hands-on implementation. Completed core React 19 patterns (Server Actions, useActionState, useOptimistic). Progressing to Performance & Streaming phase.
**Next Action**: Complete remaining tasks in `docs/TASKS.md` (Granular Suspense, Middleware, Caching).

## Documentation

- **`docs/TASKS.md`**: Detailed checklist of learning objectives and implementation tasks.
- **`docs/JOURNAL.md`**: Chronological log of decisions, fixes, and session notes.
- **`AGENTS.md`**: Guidelines for the AI agent (commands, conventions).
