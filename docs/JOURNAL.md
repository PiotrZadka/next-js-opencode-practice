- **Scaffold**: Initialized Next.js project (App Router, TS, Tailwind).
- **Environment**: Updated `AGENTS.md` with build/lint commands.

- **Infrastructure**: Explained Subagents (Architect, Mentor, Reviewer) and their roles.
- **Customization**: Updated custom agent definitions in `.opencode/agent/` with strict context-awareness rules.
- **Context Strategy**: Implemented a "Read-Before-Act" strategy for all agents to ensure alignment with project goals.
- **Reorganization**: Moved project management files (`PLAN.md`, `TASKS.md`, `JOURNAL.md`) to the `docs/` directory for better root cleanliness.
- **Maintenance**: Updated all agent guidelines and documentation to reflect the new file structure.
