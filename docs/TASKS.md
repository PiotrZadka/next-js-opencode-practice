# Learning Tasks & Roadmap

Use this file to track specific implementation tasks. Mark them as complete (`[x]`) when you feel confident in the concept.

## Phase 1: Basics & Components
- [ ] **First Component**: Create a simple UI component (e.g., Hero section) to test the workflow.
- [ ] **Styling**: Customize Tailwind config or add custom CSS modules to see how styling works in Next.js.
- [ ] **Layouts**: Modify `layout.tsx` to add a persistent navigation bar.

## Phase 2: Routing & Navigation
- [ ] **Basic Routing**: Create a new page (e.g., `/about`) to understand file-system routing.
- [ ] **Dynamic Routing**: Create a dynamic route (e.g., `/blog/[slug]`).
- [ ] **Navigation**: Use the `<Link>` component to navigate between pages.

## Phase 3: Data & Backend
- [ ] **Server Components**: Fetch data directly in a Server Component (async/await).
- [ ] **Client Components**: Use `useEffect` and `useState` for client-side interactivity.
- [ ] **API Routes**: Create a simple Route Handler (`app/api/hello/route.ts`).

## Phase 4: Advanced (Future)
- [ ] **Middleware**: Experiment with Next.js middleware.
- [ ] **Suspense & Loading**: Implement streaming with `loading.tsx` and `<Suspense>`.
